# GradDesign
My Graduation Project

This is codes for my Graduate Project

flash.py and html.py is used for obtaining the CPU percentage.

# Arguments 
flash.py <pid_MainPage> <pid_FlashPlayer> <timelength>

html.py <pid_page> <timelength>

# Bug Fixes
 170424 I found that flash.py and html.py doesn`t work well, because a used Anaconda Python Realease and it brings psutil 5.0.1. Then I reinstalled psutil latest version 5.2.2 and it works.
